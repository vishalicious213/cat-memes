# Cat Meme Generator

This was a Scrimba project. We were tasked to build a cat meme generator. The application displays a list of emotions. The visitor can click on an emotion to select it and then click on a checkbox to indicate if they only want to view animaged memes. Once those selections have been made, clicking the "Get Image" button rewards the visitor with a cat meme associated with the selected mood and animation/non-animation choice.

The application uses an array of local cat meme images, not an API.
